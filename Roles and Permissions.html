<p>OMS Roles and Permissions can be configured in Okta by a super administrator or an LADB user who has Okta OrgAdmin group permissions.</p>
<p>Roles and Permissions help you manage Okta user groups, including their access to specific database of titles according to their Customer Profile type.</p>
<p>In Okta, there are four user groups, with the user group definition based on the permission types on each OMS feature:</p>
